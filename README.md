# Health Tracker Project

This is an optional project in the Front-End Nanodegree Program and consists of a single page app, developed using the JavaScript library Backbone.js, that tracks the user's calorie intake.
Typing food names into the search field will display a list of matching foods as provided by the health API. Users will be able to select an item from the list and the item will be added to the list of foods the user is tracking.
The total calorie count will also update to reflect the new daily total.

## Getting Started

To load the app, download a copy of the project to your local machine and open the file index.html with your browser. You should replace the API key with your own key, after getting it from [Nutritionix](https://www.nutritionix.com/). Alternatively, you can load the app online from this [GitHub Pages project repository](https://daniel-234.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-health-tracker/).

## Built With

* [UnderscoreJS](http://underscorejs.org/) - A JavaScript library that provides a set of useful functional programming helpers
* [BackboneJS](http://backbonejs.org/) - A framework to supply structure to JavaScript-heavy applications
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) - A JavaScript library for simpler HTML manipulation and event handling
* [Nutritionix API](https://developer.nutritionix.com/docs/v1_1) - The third party API used to provide information to the user about calories

* I took some code from these two answers on Stackoverflow to make the AJAX request:
* [Stackoverflow - jQuery async and JSON data](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5644451/jquery-async-and-json-data)
* [Stackoverflow - Append AJAX result to div](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29432997/append-ajax-result-to-div)
* To refactor the app, I started from a simple `Hello, world!` page writing piece by piece the code taken from this post:
* [Adrian Mejia - Backbone.JS for Absolute Beginners - Getting Started (Part1: Intro)](http://adrianmejia.com/blog/2012/09/11/backbone-dot-js-for-absolute-beginners-getting-started/)
* And then revisited the Backbone JS modules in this second article:
* [Adrian Mejia - Backbone JS for Absolute Beginners - Getting Started (Patt 2: Models, Collections and Views)](http://adrianmejia.com/blog/2012/09/13/backbone-js-for-absolute-beginners-getting-started-part-2/)
* A very helpful resource on AJAX requests:
* [Stackoverflow - How do I return the response from an asynchronous call?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14220321/how-do-i-return-the-response-from-an-asynchronous-call)

* [Stackoverflow - AJAX request in Backbone View render function](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17113263/ajax-request-in-backbone-view-render-function)
* Some articles helped me solve the problem of moving the AJAX call from the View to the Model and separate concerns according to the MV* pattern:
